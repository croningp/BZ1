# BZ-CA

Platform to physically embody cellular-automaton using Belousov-Zhabotinsky
reaction-diffusion chemistry in addressably stirred cells.

## Aims of project
* Create working platform of addressable magnetic stirrers
* Use platform to demonstrate control over cell oscillations
* Control patterns of oscillating cell arrays using machine learning


## Platform TODO:
1. Test stirrers with new magnet mounts
2. Stop power oscillation
3. Determine minumum speed for each motor
4. Test working platform with BZ chemistry
